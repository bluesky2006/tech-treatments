# Tech Treatments 🛠️

Friendly, jargon-free computer help for homes and small businesses in Somerset.

**Tech Treatments** is a local computer support website and service offering repairs, upgrades, custom builds and everyday tech help for non-technical users. The site is designed to be calm, clear and approachable — explaining services in plain English and making it easy to get in touch without pressure.

The project combines a real-world service business with a thoughtfully designed, accessible web presence built using modern frontend tooling.

## 📦 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bluesky2006/tech-treatments.git
cd tech-treatments
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the app locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

For the contact form to send mail, set these server environment variables:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@your-verified-domain.com
CONTACT_TO_EMAIL=techtreatments@gmail.com
```

`CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL` should be a sender address verified with Resend. Using an arbitrary Gmail address as the sender is likely to fail.
