# Tech Treatments 🛠️

Friendly, jargon-free computer help for homes and small businesses in Somerset.

**Tech Treatments** is a local computer support website and service offering repairs, upgrades, custom builds and everyday tech help for non-technical users. The site is designed to be calm, clear and approachable — explaining services in plain English and making it easy to get in touch without pressure.
